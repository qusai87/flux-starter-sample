## Egghead React Flux Example App

This app requires node.js!

With node installed, you will also need to install **gulp** globally:

`npm i -g gulp`

Now, from the project directory of the master branch install the local dependencies:

`npm install`

Now run `gulp` in the project folder. This builds the project in the `dist` folder and watches for any changes. You can serve the `dist` folder. httpster is a great option for this (`npm i -g httpster`).
